    "So far, you've learned very important fundamental concepts in Machine Learning such as supervised learning (e.g. classification and regression) vs unsupervised learning (e.g. clustering), overfitting, model evaluation, and performance measures (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, MSE, etc.). You've learned that two of the most common approaches in supervised learning are regression and classification. In this assignment, you are going to practice what you've learned so far by building ML models and applying them on data.\n",

    "<b>Very Important Note:</b> Read ALL the instructions in this notebook very carefully. **Wherever the documentation link is provided, click on the links and read the documentation!** Careless reading and skipping instructions are major sources of making mistakes and losing points in your assignments. Also note that this assignment has three parts and includes multiple steps and questions. You're strongly recommended to get started early and plan to finish well before the due date. Technical problems or other issues/questions on the due date or just a day before would NOT be accepted as an excuse for extension."

    "Debugging the codes and error resolution are ALWAYS the students' responsbility regardless of the source or the cause of the error. This policy will be enforced in email communications and the office hours. Keep in mind that all assignments are individual graded tasks. Any collaboration with other students is strictly prohibited and is considered as cheating. Students should NOT share any answer, solution, or code with other students. Violations of these policies would be penalized according to UMBC academic integrity policy.\n",

    "**You must run ALL cells** and get the correct outputs for all cells and give complete answers to all questions. **Cells/codes with no output get zero!**\n",

    "Wherever needed, you should replace `...` elipsis with your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "`...` may indicate one or more lines of missing codes. Some outputs are provided to you to use as reference and to verify that your output is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing Effect on Grade**: Preprocessing steps are so critical in each part and you should pay special attention to make sure that you do all preprocessing steps correctly. That is why the reference outputs have been provided in preprocessing steps. Your notebook would become ineligible for grading implementation parts if you have wrong results/outputs of preprocessing, so be extremely careful with all preprocessing steps. "

    "\n",
    "(a) Both classifiers performed quite poorly for this particular dataset. A good performance for these models would require a relatively high percentage of both precision and recall, meaning the models are able to predict many items within the dataset correctly. This does not seem to be the case for both of these models however. The rf_classifier has almost no recall (~1%) with perfect precision(100%). This implies that the `rf_classifier` is 100% correct when it claims that an instance has had a stroke but is only able to correctly identify ~1% of cases where a stroke has occurred. The `xgb_classifier` is only correct 20% of the time it claims that a stroke has occurred and is able to identify ~2% of cases where a stroke has occurred. A low recall rate for a stroke-predicting model could lead to many people being told they are not at risk for strokes when they actually are. A low precision score would result in many false positives when predicting strokes. These models, as they are now, would likely do more harm than good if they were to be deployed in a real-world scenario. \n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Accuracy is not a good indicator of performance because it's possible that the model learns to do what is essentially guessing \"no stroke\" for every item it's being tested on. This would be caused by the highly unbalanced structure of the data. The dataset being used is unbalanced because there are significantly more `No Stroke` data points than there are `Stroke` data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "(c) If possible I would gather more data that represents the `Stroke` class better and add it to the data set. If adding new and more representative instances to the dataset is not possible a technique called <ins>undersampling</ins> could be used to reduce the ratio of `Stroke` to `No Stroke` classes. This technique consists of intentionally limiting the number instances that that appear in the training data labeled `No Stroke` while maintaining the same number of `Stroke` instances. <ins>Oversampling</ins> works in a similar manner but adds copies of existing `Stroke` instances to the data set to increase the proportion of `Stroke` to `No Stroke` instances. Adding artificially created `Stroke` instances that are similar to the existing instances could also be an option. Any way to increase the amount of `Stroke` class instances present in the data would be a good approach to possibly improving the performance."

    "- **Q4** [2 points]- Check the `best_rf` performance scores and explain whether or not fine-tuning hyperparameters using `GridSearch` helped resolve the performance issues with this imablanced dataset. Explain why COMPLETELY. You must justify your answer and make arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER: \n",
    "Fine-tuning hyperparameters for this data set actually resulted in a worse performance compared to no tuning. Both scores for precision and recall dropped dramatically after `GridSearch` supposedly found the best combination. Precision and recall dropped from 1 and 0.2 (for RF and XGBoost respectively) to 0 for both values. The balanced accuracy between the default hyperparameter values and \"optimized\" dropped as well, going from 50.6% to 50%. GridSearch did not resolve the performance issues caused by the imbalanced data set - it actually made things worse overall for the values I used in GridSearch."

    "- **Q5** [2 points]- Checking the ROC curves of Random Forest and XGBoost, and without seeing AUC scores, how would you determine which classifier has a better performance? Explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "The best-performing classifier would have its ROC curve peak be closer to the top-left corner of the axes when visually compared to the ROC curve of other classifiers. A rough visual inspection of the area under the curves could also be done as well. For example, the curve for the RF classifier obviously has more area when compared to the XGBoost classifier because the RF plots higher for almost all values of (x,y). A ROC curve that is, generally speaking, above another ROC curve, performs better because it will have, on average, higher true positive rates and lower false positive rates for each point on the graph.

    "- **Q6** [2 points]- Based on the ROC curves and auc scores, can you say that these classifiers have a good performance? In other words, is ROC curve a good indicator for classifier performance for this dataset? Justify your answer with clear arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER: \n",
    "The ROC curve by itself is not a great indicator of performance for this dataset simply because it could be misleading. A cursory glance at the AUC score of 0.85 for the random forest classifier indicates that the model is performing decently well. This is misleading in this instance because the model is obviously not performing well if it cannot predict even one stroke correctly (0 precision and recall). As I explained earlier, a high recall score is more desired for this model than a high precision score (high scores for both are ideal). A low recall score could result in many cases of potential strokes being missed by the model (very bad) while a low precision score would result in more false positives (still bad but much less so). Evaluating a model based off of a single performance metric seems like a very bad idea overall. Many relevant metrics should be evaluated when determining the performance for a model."
